# question 2
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# thoughtful and well explained analysis

# question 3
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# you didn't really interpret the output of the validation: 
# would have been worth checking the PreText documentation to figure out what to make of the results. 

# overall code quality: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# excellent and well commented
# in future do not include earlier versions of the code that didn't work. You can simply mention that you tried to run things a different way unsuccessfully.

# overall interpretation: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# excellent. Thoughtful and meticulous, except for the PreText part, which lost you a little I think.
